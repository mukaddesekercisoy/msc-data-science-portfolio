# MSc Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio presents an applied data science project completed as part of the MSc Data Science programme at the University of Sheffield.  
The project focuses on statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modelling using real-world urban air quality data.

## Project

### IJC437 – Introduction to Data Science  
**Short-Term Urban Air Pollution Dynamics in London:  
Diurnal Patterns of NO₂ and PM₂.₅, Meteorological Influences, and Prediction of High ΔNO₂ (Traffic Increment) Events**

This project analyses multi-year London air quality data from both traffic (roadside) and urban background monitoring sites.  
Meteorological variables are integrated to examine diurnal pollution patterns, quantify traffic-related pollution increments, and support short-term prediction of high ΔNO₂ events.

The work applies an end-to-end data science pipeline including data gathering, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical modelling, and visualisation.
